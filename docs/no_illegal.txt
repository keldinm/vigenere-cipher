Pseudocode: explains the function that checks if the user entered any illegal
characters in the message or the key

1. loops the number of times equivalent to the size of the length of text
being checked at the time
2. if in the current element being looked at in the text contains anything
in the ascii chart that is higher than '~' or lower than ' ' (space) tell
where the function was called that yes there was an illegal character found
3. if we go through every element in the text and no ascii character higher
than '~' or lower than ' ' (space) is found tell where the function was
called that no illegal character was found
